# PristineUI — Documentation Site

This repository contains the source code for the PristineUI documentation website.  
The site is open source and available at: https://pristineui.dev

PristineUI is a Tailwind-first React component library focused on clean, minimal, and modern UI building blocks.  
This repository covers the public docs, demos, and marketing site. It is not the component library package itself.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

(You can also use npm, yarn, or bun if preferred.)

Once running locally, visit: http://localhost:3000

## Learning More

The project is built on Next.js, React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.  
If you're unfamiliar with any of those, their official documentation is a good starting point.

- Next.js: https://nextjs.org/docs
- TailwindCSS: https://tailwindcss.com
- React: https://react.dev

## Notes

This repository is for the documentation site only.  
The actual UI library package can be found on npm as:

`@gmook9/pristine-ui`

## Contributing

PristineUI is open source. Pull requests for improvements, documentation fixes, examples, or clarifications are welcome.
